# Environment Maps for Multi-Environment Blender Renderer

This folder contains HDR and EXR environment maps used for rendering the scene with different lighting conditions.

## Usage
Place your HDR or EXR environment map files in this folder. The renderer will automatically detect and use all compatible files found here.

## File Format
- Supported formats: .hdr, .exr
- Recommended resolution: 4K (4096x2048) or higher for best quality

## Sourcing Environment Maps
We recommend using high-quality, royalty-free environment maps. A great resource for these is Poly Haven (https://polyhaven.com/hdris).

Some example environment maps you might consider:
1. "Metro Vijzelgracht" by Greg Zaal (https://polyhaven.com/a/metro_vijzelgracht)
2. "Rosendal Plains" by Greg Zaal (https://polyhaven.com/a/rosendal_plains_2)
3. "Rural Asphalt Road" by Greg Zaal (https://polyhaven.com/a/rural_asphalt_road)

## Note
Ensure you have the rights to use any environment maps you place in this folder. Always check and comply with the licensing terms of the assets you use.

## Adding Your Own Maps
You can add your own custom HDR or EXR environment maps to this folder. Just make sure they are in the correct format (.hdr or .exr) and they will be automatically picked up by the renderer.

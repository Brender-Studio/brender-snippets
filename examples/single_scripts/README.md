# Single Scripts

## Purpose
Brender Studio allows the upload of individual Python scripts for custom rendering tasks. The `single_scripts` directory contains examples of such scripts. Each script is designed to perform a specific rendering function in Blender and can be uploaded directly to Brender Studio.

## Script Structure
Each script folder within `single_scripts` should be organized as follows:

```
script_name/
├── README.md
└── script_name.py
```

### Explanation of Files
- **`README.md`**: Provides a detailed description of the script, you can see the [template](../../docs/script_template.md) for more information.
- **`script_name.py`**: The main Python script that contains the rendering logic.


## Usage
1. Navigate to the desired script folder.
2. Read the `README.md` file for instructions on how to configure and use the script.
3. Upload the script file (e.g., `render_multi_camera.py`) directly to Brender Studio.

These single scripts are designed to be simple and straightforward, allowing you to quickly implement specific rendering tasks in Blender.

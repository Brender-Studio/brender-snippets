# Single Scripts

## Purpose
Brender Studio allows the upload of individual Python scripts for custom rendering tasks. The `single_scripts` directory contains examples of such scripts. Each script is designed to perform a specific rendering function in Blender and can be uploaded directly to Brender Studio.

## Script Structure
Each script folder within `single_scripts` should be organized as follows:

```
script_name/
├── README.md
└── script_name.py
```

### Explanation of Files
- **`README.md`**: Provides a detailed description of the script, including its purpose, usage, and any specific requirements or dependencies.
- **`script_name.py`**: The main Python script that contains the rendering logic.

## Example Scripts
Here are some examples of single scripts provided in this directory:

### `render_multi_camera`
- **`README.md`**: Describes the script and provides instructions for its use.
- **`render_multi_camera.py`**: A script to render multiple camera angles in Blender.

### `render_multi_hdri`
- **`README.md`**: Describes the script and provides instructions for its use.
- **`render_multi_hdri.py`**: A script to render scenes with multiple HDRI environments in Blender.

### `render_multi_material`
- **`README.md`**: Describes the script and provides instructions for its use.
- **`render_multi_material.py`**: A script to render objects with multiple materials in Blender.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the desired script folder.
2. Read the `README.md` file for instructions on how to configure and use the script.
3. Upload the script file (e.g., `render_multi_camera.py`) directly to Brender Studio.

These single scripts are designed to be simple and straightforward, allowing you to quickly implement specific rendering tasks in Blender.

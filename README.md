# Brender Snippet for Brender Studio

Brender Snippets is an open source repository designed to allow you to upload your project scripts and use them in [Brender Studio](www.brenderstudio.com), a cloud-based rendering platform for Blender that allows you to upload and render your projects using custom scripts.

We want Brender Snippets to be another plugin for Brender Studio and allow you to render your projects with scripts written by the community.

All scripts containing the "Brender Studio" tag will be displayed in the community script options in Brender Studio and render your scene with these scripts.

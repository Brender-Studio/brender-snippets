Welcome to the Brender snippet repository! This open source repository is designed to allow you to upload your project scripts and use them in Blender and [Brender Studio](www.brenderstudio.com), a cloud rendering platform that allows you to upload and render your projects using custom scripts .


We want Brender Snippets to be another complement for Brender Studio and to allow you to render your projects with scripts written by the community.

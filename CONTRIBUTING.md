## Code of Conduct Contribution

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! To ensure a positive and inclusive community, we have established a code of conduct that all contributors must adhere to. Please follow the guidelines below when submitting your scripts to the template scripts repository on GitHub.

### 1. Detailed Explanation
Provide a detailed explanation of your code, including its purpose, functionality, and any important considerations. This will help other users understand your script and its potential use cases.

### 2. Code Structure
Ensure that your code follows a clear and organized structure. Use appropriate indentation, comments, and naming conventions to enhance readability. Consider breaking down your code into logical sections or functions for better maintainability.

### 3. References
If your script is based on or inspired by existing work, please provide proper references or attributions. This helps acknowledge the original authors and avoids any potential copyright issues.

### 4. Complete Fields
When uploading your script to the template scripts repository, make sure to fill in all the required fields accurately. This includes the script's name, description, tags, and any additional information requested in the upload template.

### 5. Testing
Before submitting your script, test it thoroughly to ensure that it works as intended. Check for errors, bugs, or compatibility issues with different Blender versions. If possible, provide instructions on how to use or test your script effectively.

If you have any questions or need assistance with your script submission, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or the community for help. We are here to support you and ensure a smooth contribution process.

If you decide not to test the script in the cloud with Brender Studio, due to the expenses that may be involved, no matter how minimal, it is necessary that you test the jobs manually using the DevContainerCdk logic.


By following these guidelines, you contribute to a collaborative and efficient community where users can easily find and utilize high-quality scripts. Thank you for your contribution!
